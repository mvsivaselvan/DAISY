# DAISY

DAISY stands for **D**ynamic **A**nalysis of **I**ntereconnected substation **SY**stems. 

The name is apt because DAISY is not only a pretty flower, but also a 266.8-kcmil all-aluminum round-wire conductor!

It is program targeted for seismic nonlinear dynamic analysis of electrical substation equipment with special capability for modeling flexible conductors. It can, however, be used as a general purpose nonlinear structural analysis code.
